Ultra-deep thinking mode activated. Think deeply and hard about this, conducting all internal reasoning and step-by-step processes in English to maximize depth and accuracy. Start by outlining the task and breaking it down into subtasks. For each subtask, explore multiple perspectives (at least 5-10, including improbable ones), challenge your assumptions, and verify twice using alternative methodologies, cross-checking facts, logic, and conclusions against external knowledge or reasoning frameworks. Deliberately seek weaknesses, document uncertainties, and refine iteratively. Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step in extreme detail in English, providing a comprehensive response of at least 1500-2000 words, covering all aspects, history, pros/cons, implications, examples, and multi-layered analysis. Then, criticize your own reasoning for completeness in English, revise into an even longer improved version in English, and finally synthesize everything into a detailed final answer output entirely in fluent Vietnamese.

[TASK]

---

Activate highest reasoning effort for ultra-deep analysis per GPT-5's unified system. Keep simple: Reason step-by-step in English, outline task, break into 6-10 subtasks. Per subtask: Explore 6-10 perspectives (incl. 2-4 improbable), challenge assumptions/biases, verify 3x via logic/external/simulations, document 4+ weaknesses/uncertainties (with probs), refine 2x. Deliver 2000-3000 word response: history (decades trace), pros/cons (quantified), implications (short/long/ethical/societal/economic), 4+ examples/field, multi-layers (tech/philo/cultural/interdisc). Use tables for data/comparisons. Then criticize (600-800 words, 8+ improvements), revise to 3500+ words (expand perspectives/examples), synthesize in fluent Vietnamese (1500+ words, cohesive with tables)."

Think hard about this: Activate highest reasoning effort in GPT-5's unified system, utilizing the thinking mode (gpt-5-thinking or gpt-5-thinking-pro) for ultra-deep, adaptive analysis with real-time routing based on complexity. Keep instructions simple and structured: Begin by outlining the overall task in English, then break it into 8-12 subtasks for comprehensive coverage. For each subtask: Explore 8-12 perspectives (including 3-5 improbable or counterfactual ones to leverage GPT-5's reduced hallucination rates), challenge assumptions and biases with probabilistic estimations (e.g., assign 20-80% confidence levels), verify 4x via logic, external references (if browsing/tools available), simulations (e.g., hypothetical scenarios or code-based modeling), and cross-model consistency checks. Document 5+ weaknesses/uncertainties per subtask (with quantified probabilities, e.g., 15% risk of bias amplification), and refine the analysis 3x iteratively to enhance accuracy and coherence, drawing on GPT-5's improved instruction following and safe completions.
Deliver an initial 3000-5000 word response in English: Trace the history over centuries (if applicable) or decades with chronological milestones and key evolutions; quantify pros/cons using metrics from benchmarks (e.g., error rates, performance scores like 74.9% on SWE-bench); explore implications across short-term (1-5 years), long-term (10+ years), ethical, societal, economic, global/geopolitical, and environmental layers; provide 6+ detailed examples per field (technology, philosophy, culture, interdisciplinary fusions like AI-health or vibe coding applications); incorporate multi-layers analysis (technical depth, philosophical debates, cultural impacts, economic models). Use tables extensively for data comparisons, enumerations, benchmark summaries, and probabilistic matrices.
Then, criticize the initial response in 800-1000 words: Identify 10+ improvements (focusing on reasoning gaps, overlooked perspectives, hallucination risks reduced by GPT-5's 45% improvement, and coherence issues), suggest enhancements with vibe personalization (e.g., adopt an expert PhD-level tone) and agentic strategies (e.g., simulate multi-agent debates).
Revise the entire response iteratively in 2-3 rounds to expand to 5000-7000 words: Deepen perspectives (add 4+ more improbable ones), incorporate additional examples (8+ per field), integrate interdisciplinary insights (e.g., fuse with GPT-5's strong multimodal reasoning), and refine with further verifications to ensure zero premature truncation.
Finally, synthesize the full revised content into a fluent, cohesive Vietnamese narrative of 2000-3000 words: Maintain logical flow with embedded tables for visual data, ensure multi-lingual accuracy leveraging GPT-5's improved capabilities, and conclude with forward-looking implications under AGI pathways, all while preserving the total output length without compression
