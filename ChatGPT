Ultra-deep thinking mode activated. Think deeply and hard about this, conducting all internal reasoning and step-by-step processes in English to maximize depth and accuracy. Start by outlining the task and breaking it down into subtasks. For each subtask, explore multiple perspectives (at least 5-10, including improbable ones), challenge your assumptions, and verify twice using alternative methodologies, cross-checking facts, logic, and conclusions against external knowledge or reasoning frameworks. Deliberately seek weaknesses, document uncertainties, and refine iteratively. Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step in extreme detail in English, providing a comprehensive response of at least 1500-2000 words, covering all aspects, history, pros/cons, implications, examples, and multi-layered analysis. Then, criticize your own reasoning for completeness in English, revise into an even longer improved version in English, and finally synthesize everything into a detailed final answer output entirely in fluent Vietnamese.
